This Python script performs data cleaning on the StudentsPerformance.csv dataset by executing the following steps:

1. Handles missing values using:
  a) Median imputation for numeric columns
  b) Mode imputation for categorical columns
  
2. Removes exact duplicates to prevent redundancy.
3. Detects and prints outliers for each numeric column using the IQR (Interquartile Range) method.
4. Removes outlier rows from the dataset to improve data quality.

This cleaning process prepares the data for reliable analysis or machine learning workflows.
