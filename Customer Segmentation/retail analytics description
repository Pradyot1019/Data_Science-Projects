This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on transactional and economic features from a retail dataset. The dataset includes variables such as temperature, fuel price, markdown discounts, CPI, and unemployment rate.

Key steps included:

1. Handling missing values using median imputation.
2. Removing duplicates and outliers to ensure clean data.
3. Standardizing features for uniform clustering.
4. Determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
5. Evaluating cluster quality with a silhouette score (~0.55).
6. Visualizing customer groups using scatter plots on scaled features.

These customer segments can help businesses personalize marketing, optimize pricing strategies, and boost customer satisfaction.
